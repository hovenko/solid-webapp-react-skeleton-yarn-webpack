# Solid web application skeleton

This base project helps to get started with Solid web application development.

For building, it uses:

* Webpack to create a web application distribution and supplies a developer friendly web server.
* Yarn for node package dependency management.

Included dependencies are:

* rdflib and solid-auth-client for working with a Solid POD (and other RDF data).
* React, a web component framework (DOM overlay).
* Material-UI, a React extension with useful web components.
